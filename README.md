# Movie Recommender System

This is a Python-based movie recommender system that uses user-based collaborative filtering to recommend movies based on ratings they have given. The system utilises a dataset of 100,000+ ratings, by 600+ different users for over 9000+ different movies. This data exists in a MongoDB database that the system connects to and interacts with (see the database folder for information on how). The system also contains an evaluator, which evaluates the performance of the recommender system based on various evaluation metrics such as Hit rate - see evaluator.py for more information on this.

The system is in progress, but still working, meaning that it still works as a valid recommender system, but it is still open to extension and I am still to add more features such as incorporating the time of a user's rating into the recommender system so that more recent reviews are weighted more. All the code here is written by, of course the concept of user-based collaborative filtering (that I am using) is not originally sourced and is something widely used in industry, I learnt how to use it and how it works through readings on the internet. I have used various ML libraries in Python such as Pandas and Surprise that help with generating the recommendations and provide some algorithms that the evaluator uses.



## Prerequisites

Before you begin, please make sure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.12 (Specifically this version)
- pip (Pythonâ€™s package installer)

You can install Python 3.12 using (Mac):
```
brew install python@3.12
```
(Assuming you have homebrew installed)

Or on Windows via the installation page: https://www.python.org/downloads/


## Setup Instructions

### 1. It is recommended to setup a python virtual environment where you install all the required dependencies:

#### First create a venv in Python3.12 (ensure you are at the base directory):
```
python3.12 -m venv your_venv_name
```

#### Activate the venv (Mac):

```
source your_venv_name/bin/activate
```

#### Activate the venv (Windows):
```
your_venv_name\Scripts\activate
```

### 2. Install the required dependencies from the requirements.txt file:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Run the script to generate recommendations:

```
python3.12 main.py
```

### 4. Run unit tests with the following:
```
python -m unittest tests.test_recommendations
```
```
python -m unittest tests.test_evaluator
```
