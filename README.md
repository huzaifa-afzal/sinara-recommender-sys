# Movie Recommender System

This is a Python-based movie recommender system that uses user-based collaborative filtering to recommend movies based on ratings they have given. The system utilises a dataset of 100,000+ ratings, by 600+ different users for over 9000+ different movies. This data exists in a MongoDB database that the system interacts with.
